# REST API

## What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on stateless, client-server communication, typically using HTTP.

## Key Principles

- **Stateless**: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.
- **Client-Server**: Separation of frontend (client) and backend (server).
- **Cacheable**: Responses must indicate if they are cacheable or not.
- **Uniform Interface**: A consistent way to interact with resources.

## HTTP Methods

- `GET`: Read data from the server.
- `POST`: Create new data.
- `PUT`: Update existing data.
- `DELETE`: Remove data.

## Example

```http
GET /api/users
POST /api/users
PUT /api/users/123
DELETE /api/users/123
```
## Introduction to Node.js

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows JavaScript to run on the server-side.

### Key Features

- **Non-blocking I/O**: Efficient handling of multiple requests.
- **Event-driven architecture**: Uses an event loop and callback functions.
- **Single-threaded**: But can handle concurrent operations using asynchronous code.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Manages thousands of open-source packages.

### Basic Example

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello, Node.js!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
## Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

### Relational Databases (SQL)

- Based on tables (rows & columns).
- Use SQL (Structured Query Language).
- Data is structured and uses relationships (foreign keys).
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

### Pros:
- Strong consistency.
- Structured schema.

### Cons:
- Less flexible for unstructured data.
- Scaling can be more complex.

## Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

- Store data in formats like documents, key-value, graphs.
- Schema-less (flexible structure).
- Examples: MongoDB, Firebase, CouchDB.

### Pros:
- Great for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Easy to scale horizontally.

### Cons:
- May not support complex joins.
- Eventual consistency instead of strong consistency (in some types).

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database. Data is stored in **JSON-like documents** with dynamic schema.

## Core Concepts

- **Database** → Container for collections
- **Collection** → Container for documents (similar to table)
- **Document** → Individual record in JSON format

## Basic MongoDB Commands

```js
// Insert a document
db.users.insertOne({ name: "Aliza", age: 22 });

// Find documents
db.users.find({});

// Update a document
db.users.updateOne({ name: "Aliza" }, { $set: { age: 23 } });

// Delete a document
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Aliza" });
```

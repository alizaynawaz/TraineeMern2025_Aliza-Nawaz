## Loops and Iteration in JavaScript

Loops help you repeat actions in your code without rewriting the same line again and again.

**Key points:**

- `for` loop → repeats a block of code a set number of times  
- `while` loop → repeats as long as a condition is true  
- `for...of` → loops over values in arrays  
- `for...in` → loops over object keys

**Example:**
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
## Conditions in JavaScript
Conditions let you make decisions in your code depending on true/false logic.

Key points:

if → runs a block if condition is true

else → runs a block if the if fails

else if → test another condition

switch → simpler for multiple choices

## Arrays in JavaScript
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

Key points:

Use square brackets [] to create arrays

Store any data type (numbers, strings, objects, etc.)

Use indexes to access items, starting from 0

Have useful methods like push(), pop(), shift(), map(), and filter()

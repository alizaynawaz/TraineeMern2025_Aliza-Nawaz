## Basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It is used to style and design HTML pages, making websites look attractive and user-friendly.

**Key points:**

- Controls the look of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, borders, and spacing  
- Separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) for easier maintenance  
- Supports responsive design, so websites look good on phones, tablets, and desktops  
- Uses selectors to target elements and apply styles  
- Can add effects like hover states, animations, and transitions  
- Works with external stylesheets to keep code clean and organized
**Example of CSS:**
```css
button {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

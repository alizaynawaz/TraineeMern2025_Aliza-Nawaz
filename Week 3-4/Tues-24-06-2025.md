## Loops and Iteration in JavaScript

Loops help you repeat actions in your code without rewriting the same line again and again.

**Key points:**

- `for` loop → repeats a block of code a set number of times  
- `while` loop → repeats as long as a condition is true  
- `for...of` → loops over values in arrays  
- `for...in` → loops over object keys

**Example:**
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

## JavaScript Crash

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser. It makes websites interactive by handling things like clicks, forms, and animations.

**Key points:**

- Runs directly in web browsers  
- Works with HTML and CSS to build dynamic websites  
- Supports modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue  
- Easy to get started with, but very powerful

## Variables in JavaScript

Variables store data in JavaScript, like numbers or text. You can change their values later if needed.

**Key points:**

- `let` allows you to change values  
- `const` is for constants that cannot be reassigned  
- `var` is the older way (less recommended)

**Example:**
```js
let name = "Aliza";
const age = 21;
## Object Introduction

Objects store data as keyâ€“value pairs, letting you group related data and functions.

**Key points:**

- Created with `{}`  
- Properties store data  
- Methods are functions inside the object

**Example:**
```js
const person = {
  name: "Aliza",
  age: 21,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

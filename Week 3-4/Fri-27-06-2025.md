##  Git Branches, Merge, and Rebase

### Branches
- Branches help you work on different features or bug fixes **independently** from the main codebase.
- Create a new branch:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-branch
### Merging

-   Merging integrates changes from one branch into another.
    
-   Example: Merge `feature-branch` into `main`
### Rebase

-   Rebase moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
    
-   It helps keep history **linear and clean**
    
    `git checkout feature-branch
    git rebase main`
    ## Git Tips and Tricks

-   View commit history:  
    `git log --oneline --graph` 
    
-   Undo last commit but keep changes:
    `git reset --soft HEAD~1` 
    
-   Discard unstaged changes:
    `git checkout -- filename` 
    
-   View what has changed:
    `git status
    git diff` 
    
-   Stash changes:
    `git stash
    git stash pop`
    ## Resolving Merge Conflicts

###   What is a merge conflict?

-   Happens when Git can’t automatically decide which version to keep.
    

### Steps to resolve:

1.  Open conflicted file – Git marks it with:
    Incoming changes
    
2.  Manually edit the file, keeping the correct code.
    
3.  After resolving:
    `git add .
    git commit`
